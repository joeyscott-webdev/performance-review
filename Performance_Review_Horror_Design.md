# Performance Review

## Horror Design & Narrative Escalation Document

# Core Horror Vision

This game begins as subtle psychological discomfort and escalates into
oppressive corporate existential horror.

The player is not fighting a monster.

The player is being processed.

The horror evolves from awkward performance review tension into the
realization that the office is not a workplace --- it is a system of
permanent containment.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Phase 1: Subtle Unease (Loops 1--2)

The first review feels normal.

-   Fluorescent lights hum softly.
-   The manager speaks calmly and professionally.
-   The forms ask predictable corporate questions.
-   The rating is slightly lower than expected.

Small inconsistencies appear:

-   The manager insists this is the first review.
-   Some answers appear pre-filled.
-   A sentence you selected last loop is slightly reworded.
-   The exit door is locked "for privacy reasons."

The horror is mild and psychological --- something feels off, but
nothing is overtly threatening.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Phase 2: Behavioral Monitoring (Loops 3--4)

The system begins responding to resistance.

If the player questions ratings: - The manager's tone becomes slightly
rehearsed. - Dialogue options become narrower. - Certain choices
disappear.

Office signage appears subtly:

"COMPLIANCE ENSURES CONTINUITY."\
"GROWTH IS MANDATORY."

Employee motivational posters now depict:

-   Smiling stick figures entering a machine labeled "DEVELOPMENT"
-   A flowchart showing "Non-Compliance → Retraining → Improvement"

Lighting flickers longer than it should.

The manager occasionally refers to previous answers incorrectly --- or
too accurately.

The player begins to feel observed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Phase 3: Loss of Autonomy (Loops 5--6)

The office changes shape.

-   The exit door disappears.
-   Windows now show only darkness.
-   The hallway outside loops infinitely.
-   Office walls feel closer.

The forms change more aggressively:

-   Words like "growth" become "correction."
-   "Improvement Plan" becomes "Behavioral Realignment."
-   Your name is replaced with "Employee."

Posters become disturbing:

-   Stick figure workers falling into a grinder labeled "OPTIMIZATION."
-   A smiling manager holding a clipboard while employees march into a
    furnace labeled "RESTRUCTURE."
-   "YOUR VALUE IS YOUR OUTPUT."

If the player resists repeatedly:

The manager calmly states:

"Non-compliance will result in retraining."

The screen briefly flashes imagery of:

-   Rows of identical desks.
-   Workers seated motionless.
-   Hands signing papers repeatedly.

The player never sees retraining directly --- only implied mechanical
processing.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Phase 4: Corporate Enslavement Horror (Late Loops)

The system drops pretense.

The manager says:

"You are not here to succeed."\
"You are here to improve."\
"You will remain until improvement is achieved."

The documents no longer ask questions.

They state conclusions.

-   "You have demonstrated hesitation."
-   "You require restructuring."
-   "Departure is not authorized."

The signature box appears automatically.

Refusing to sign:

-   The pen signs by itself.
-   Your previous signature is already present.
-   The document reads: "Signed."

The office becomes industrial.

-   Distant metallic grinding sounds.
-   Conveyor belt audio.
-   Rhythmic stamping noises.

Motivational posters now read:

"PRODUCTIVITY IS PURPOSE."\
"EXIT IS A PERFORMANCE METRIC."\
"YOU ARE STILL UNDER REVIEW."

One sign shows:

A stick figure attempting to leave through a door, being redirected into
a chute labeled "RETRAINING."

Another shows:

A row of employees feeding into machinery. The final output is a smiling
stick figure with a tie.

Caption: "REFINED."

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Existential Layer

The true horror is not death.

It is permanence.

The player realizes:

-   There is no promotion.
-   There is no termination.
-   There is no escape.
-   There is only iteration.

The review never ends because improvement is undefined.

The system always finds something lacking.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Psychological Themes

-   Corporate dehumanization
-   Identity erosion
-   Forced compliance
-   Endless evaluation
-   Loss of agency
-   Institutional gaslighting

The manager never screams.

The manager never threatens.

The system is calm.

The calmness is the horror.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Final Stage Possibility

In the most disturbing ending:

The player sits down for another review.

The manager says:

"Welcome. Let's begin your first performance review."

The loop counter resets to zero.

But the player remembers.

The save file does not.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Design Philosophy

The horror should escalate from:

Subtle discomfort\
→ Behavioral manipulation\
→ Loss of control\
→ Industrial processing imagery\
→ Permanent institutional imprisonment

The player should feel:

-   Trapped
-   Evaluated
-   Replaceable
-   Processed
-   Owned

Not attacked.

Processed.
